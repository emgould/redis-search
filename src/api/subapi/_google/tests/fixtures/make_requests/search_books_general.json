If so, then Python is the perfect programming language for you to learn! Would you like to: Learn how programming in Python works? Learn to automate tasks with Python? Bring your ideas to life faster and monetize them easily? But you: Have no prior knowledge about Python? Are a little bit afraid because it seems complicated? Well, if the answer to any question is \"yes,\" then the solution you are looking for is right in front of you. With this incredible bundle in your hands, you will go from beginner to pro in no time. The guides found inside this bundle are designed explicitly for people with little or no prior knowledge about Python programming. Every manual is written in a step-by-step and easy to digest manner so that you can understand Python without any trouble. Here's what this bundle about Python programming and data science can offer you: Basics of programming with Python: A comprehensive guide on how to get everything up and running. Essential tools guide: Learn how to use the best tools that are available for programming with Python. Programming made easy: Quick and easy way to learn how to make amazing and useful programs. Mastering the art of programming: Find out how to go from beginner to pro in no time with unique coding methods. Practical techniques and exercises: Put your knowledge to test and bring your ideas to life in no time. It doesn't matter if you are a beginner or you have never coded before; this guide will slowly ease you into the world of Python and data science. While most of the other similar books focus purely on theory and complicated concepts, these guides focus on a more practical approach to learning Python and data science. First of all, you'll learn basic programming concepts, such as variables, lists, classes, and loops. Then you will practice clean code writing and how to test your code safely. After that, you'll be able to put your knowledge to the test with some practical projects. Here is what else this bundle will show you: The basics of data types, variables, and structures How to properly define the data type of data structure Suitable types of operations and functions for data structuring Methods and applications of data analysis The basics of neural networks and how to create one Use of algorithm and models in data science Using data for prediction and deep learning The best thing about Python is that it's easy to learn and even easier to get up and running. By using tools like Django, for example, you can quickly bring your ideas and creations to life and start monetizing them in no time. The second best thing about learning how to program in Python is the advantage you'll have when you start learning other programming languages-after you master Python, learning different programming languages will be a piece of cake. If you want to conquer the Python programming language in no time, all you have to do is take these guides in your hands and follow the step-by-step instructions. Get Your Copy Now!",

        "description": "Python programming language has rendered itself as the language of choice for coding beginners and advanced software programmers alike. This book is written to help you master the basic concepts of Python coding and how you can utilize your coding skills to analyze a large volume of data and uncover valuable information that can otherwise be easily lost in the volume. It was designed primarily to emphasize the readability of the programming code, and its syntax enables programmers to convey ideas using fewer lines of code. Python programming language increases the speed of operation while allowing for higher efficiency in creating system integrations. Some of the highlights of the book include: - Key features and advantages of learning to code Python as well as the history of how Python programming was created - Step-by-step instructions on how to install Python on your operating systems (Windows, Mac, and Linux) - The concept of Python data types is presented in exquisite detail with various examples of each data type - How to create Python variables - Comprehensive lists of a variety of built-in functions and methods supported by Python - Basic concepts of writing efficient and effective Python codes, focusing on various programming elements - How to write if and else statements to retrieve desired information from your data - For and While loops are explained with explicit details in an easy-to-understand language - Basic concepts of big data analysis and machine learning algorithms - A brief overview of various renowned machine learning libraries All the concepts are explained with standard Python coding syntax supported with relevant examples and followed by exercises to help you test and verify your understanding of those concepts. Finally, as an added bonus you will learn some Python tips and tricks to take your machine learning programming game to the next level. Remember, knowledge is power, and with the great power you will gather from this book, you will be armed to make sound personal and professional technological choices. Your Python programming skillset will improve drastically, and you will be poised to develop your very own machine learning model! Don't you think it can be that easy? If you really want to have proof of all this, don't waste any more time! Grab your copy now!",
