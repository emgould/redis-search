      "content": "Pro basketball has returned to NBC, its home during the glory days of the 1990s. But the sport and its audience have changed.\n\nThe camera pans shakily over Manhattan's South Street Seaport, past the Empire State Building, and then a bustling Midtown intersection. \"Enter Sandman,\" by Metallica, crescendos as yellow taxis scuttle through the frame. We push in slowly on the luminous building-cum-billboard of One Times Square, which reads \"N.B.A.,\" and then \"NBC SPORTS.\" Cut to a fair-haired toddler staring into the static of a TV screen -- \"He's baaa-aaaack,\" the boy intones. Finally, the iconic visage of Michael Jordan: close up, hunched over, eyes focused, ready to strike.\n\nThis isn't the beginning of a forgotten Michael Mann film but the cold open for NBC's broadcast of Game 5 of the 1993 Eastern Conference finals between the New York Knicks and the Chicago Bulls. It's the N.B.A. at its zenith, with all its best qualities -- the narrative stakes, sense of history, larger-than-life heroes. It's this gilded era of the N.B.A. that persists in our mind's eye, shaped in no small part by NBC itself -- the network which, just weeks ago, made its return to broadcasting the league for the first time in 23 years.\n\nToday, every red carpet, popular Twitch stream, critically acclaimed A24 film and insurance commercial seems to feature the N.B.A. and its assorted stars. The games are shown in over 200 countries and in more than 50 languages. On the playgrounds of Jakarta, you're probably as likely to spot a LeBron James jersey as that of a European soccer star. And over the years, the on-court product has only improved. What has not improved, however, is the N.B.A. television broadcast. For most of recent memory, the games, as presented by ESPN/ABC and TNT, have functioned as trunk shows for live television's worst impulses: strange 3-D graphics, tacky music supervision and largely bloodless play-by-play commentary. The ratings bear this out. For the last 10 seasons, the league's viewership has seen some notable declines. Game 2 of this year's championship series was the least watched N.B.A. finals game since 2007.\n\nHow did we stray so far from the cinema of NBC's initial run? The collaboration between the N.B.A. and the network didn't just stumble into greatness. Together with the league's then-commissioner, David Stern, Dick Ebersol, a co-creator of \"Saturday Night Live\" and the recently enshrined president of NBC Sports, came up with a new vision for coverage in 1989: \"N.B.A. on NBC\" would be true entertainment. There would be top-of-broadcast cold opens and talking-head interviews, brewing rivalries, stars on the rise, legends trying to solidify legacies. Ebersol diverted the network's best producers and directors to covering the N.B.A., increasing the number of replay angles that viewers saw. This approach reaped early returns, and at the conclusion of the inaugural season, Michael Jordan and the ascendant Chicago Bulls dethroned Magic Johnson and the dynastic Los Angeles Lakers in a paradigm-shifting 1991 finals.\n\nThis was also, of course, a peak era of NBC's scripted TV, when every show was almost assuredly a hit -- \"Seinfeld,\" \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,\" \"Frasier,\" \"Friends.\" The N.B.A. slotted in neatly. Like many other tightly written shows, it had comic relief, drama and, most crucially, character-driven stories, such as Charles \"Round Mound of Rebound\" Barkley's frequent duels with Gary \"the Glove\" Payton and Shawn \"Reign Man\" Kemp. These were dynamics ripe for television, with players eager to lean into them.\n\nBut by 1999, Bulls management had broken up the band and Jordan was out of the league; team owners imposed a lockout and ratings began to slide. NBC lost the rights to the N.B.A. in 2002. Through the aughts and early 2010s, the N.B.A. was still dominant, its players' wealth and stardom climbing to new heights. But there was always the lingering feeling that we had just missed the real show.\n\nJust as basketball in the '90s was shaped by the flourishing of network television, the post-90s era, more quietly, has been reshaped by atomized media. First came YouTube, in 2005: Having access to an entire library of highlights helped fans appreciate the game's greatness while also cheapening the value of the live product. There were the blogs, then the podcasts, and then, of course, social media. Twitter and Instagram created a whole new opportunity to hear directly from the players in sometimes silly and sometimes stunningly revealing ways.\n\nIn exchange for extreme access and convenience, the casual N.B.A. fan has lost a shared framing with their hoop-loving peers. Today, being \"into the N.B.A.\" can mean any number of things. Perhaps it's watching Stephen A. Smith fat-shame Zion Williamson on ESPN's \"First Take.\" Or maybe it's watching Instagram Reels of Stephen Curry's ball wizardry, or Jaylen Brown's Twitch stream. Even the players understand this: The Portland Trail Blazers head coach, Chauncey Billups, on Carmelo Anthony's \"7 p.m. in Brooklyn\" podcast last year, recalled having to admonish a player for going on his phone and reposting his own highlight during halftime of a game they were losing by 18. And Billups himself, recently charged in an indictment related to illegal gambling, reminds us that the game is also being reshaped by sports betting. (Billups denies the charges, according to his lawyer.)\n\nJordan and Magic learned how to be television stars, while today's players package themselves for the screens in our pockets. Can the new generation of players make for good TV? And if so, is there a new generation of viewers who will reliably watch it?\n\nThis was the state of affairs NBC hoped to upend with the resurrection of its seminal \"N.B.A. on NBC.\" Frankly, I feared the worst -- that NBC would somehow pervert its own hallowed product, and \"N.B.A. on NBC\" 2.0 would be some grotesque reanimated corpse, yet another drop in the sea of zombified basketball nostalgia already flooding our feeds, our video games and even our on-court celebrations. The promos leading up to their Oct. 21 season-opening double-header didn't restore faith, either: One clip even promised an A.I.-generated version of the voice of the late announcer Jim Fagan. Yuck.\n\nThe resulting product, however, has been somewhat promising. \"N.B.A. Showtime,\" the new pre- and postgame studio show, is energetic and insightful. The lead play-by-play commentator, Mike Tirico, considered one of the best in the business, is a font of timely facts and reminiscent of the great announcers of yore. They even revived the cold open: Week 1 featured a \"Last Dance\"-style carousel of old-timers -- Patrick Ewing, Reggie Miller, Magic and, of course, Jordan -- reminding us of the glory of the network's 1.0 era, but also signaling the dawn of a new age. \"The game we all love? Oh, yeah -- it's back,\" Magic said.\n\nThere were some hiccups. The conspicuously modern sans-serif font chosen for the score bug isn't my cup of tea. Nor really are the overly busy chyrons used to display the analysts' social media handles. But I confess that the bits of nostalgia worked on me, and they paired well with good basketball. On opening night, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and the Oklahoma City Thunder clawed their way back, forcing two overtimes and eventually stealing a 125-124 victory from the Houston Rockets.\n\nI watched that first game with cautious optimism, unsure whether \"N.B.A. on NBC\" 2.0 could be the shot in the arm that live broadcasts so desperately needed. Now that I've tuned in the past few weeks, I've felt the energy start to reconsolidate. I'm looking forward to the next matchup. In February, after the conclusion of football season, NBC will debut \"Sunday Night Basketball,\" a third weekly game airing in prime time. It's NBC's big bet that a live basketball broadcast can actually get us to gather around a TV again. Time will tell whether or not we remember how to do that.\n\nSource photographs for illustration above: David Dow/NBAE, via Getty Images; Jonathan Daniel/Allsport, via Getty Images; screenshot from YouTube.",

The prediction pages reflect the current standings in the race and do not reflect personal preferences for any individual contender. As other formal (and informal) polls suggest, competitions are fluid and subject to change based on buzz and events. Predictions are updated every Thursday.\n\nOscars Best Documentary Feature Commentary (Updated Nov. 11, 2025): As the documentary race comes into sharper focus with DOC NYC ahead, and the Critics Choice Documentary Awards just announced, it's clear this year's lineup is as politically charged and emotionally resonant as ever.\n\nAt the top of the field, Geeta Gandbhir's \"The Perfect Neighbor\" has established itself as the early frontrunner. Fresh off its CCA triumph -- where it claimed best documentary feature, director, editing, archival documentary and best true crime documentary -- the Netflix release has cemented its status as both a critical and popular favorite. Gandbhir's gripping exploration of \"stand your ground\" laws through police bodycam footage has positioned the film as the kind of urgent, socially conscious storytelling that the branch tends to reward.\n\nNot far behind is Laura Poitras' \"Cover-Up,\" another Netflix acquisition, and a cerebral and fiercely investigative work examining journalist Seymour Hersh's lifelong pursuit of truth. Poitras, an Oscar winner for \"Citizenfour,\" is no stranger to the Academy, and this latest effort could easily return her to the winner's circle.\n\nPBS is in strong contention with Mstyslav Chernov's \"2000 Meters to Andriivka,\" a harrowing follow-up to his Oscar-winning \"20 Days in Mariupol.\" The film's inclusion in DOC NYC's Short List section, where 13 of the last 14 Oscar winners have appeared, only strengthens its case.\n\nHBO's \"The Alabama Solution,\" from Andrew Jarecki, brings another socially conscious angle, examining systemic failures in the American justice system. A CCA winner for best political documentary, helps bolsters its campaign as one of the year's most urgent entries.\n\nApple is betting big on \"Come See Me in the Good Light,\" a tender and deeply human portrait from director Ryan White and producer Tig Notaro chronicling the love and resilience of two poets facing terminal illness. It continues to build quiet but meaningful momentum after positive receptions that began at Sundance.\n\nWatch out for Neon's \"Orwell: 2+2=5,\" directed by Raoul Peck and co-produced by Alex Gibney. The philosophical essay film -- which won CCA honors for best score and narration -- merges historical insight with contemporary urgency, drawing parallels between Orwell's warnings and today's modern political doublespeak.\n\nAs DOC NYC kicks off its 16th edition, the race for best documentary feature feels both wide open and unusually rich. With heavyweights from Netflix, PBS, HBO, and Neon all in play, the question may not be which film wins -- but which kind of truth Academy voters choose to honor this year.",
