Jay Collins -- a decorated Army Special Forces veteran -- for a Veterans Day celebration honoring American veterans, active military and their families. The event included an honor guard, musical tribute and recognition of TGH team members who have served and are currently serving in the U.S. military. Collins, TGH President and CEO John Couris and TGH Behavioral Health Hospital CEO Doug Leonardo each shared remarks during the celebration.\n\nTAMPA, Fla., Nov. 11, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Tampa General Hospital (TGH) welcomed Florida's Lt. Governor Jay Collins to TGH's main campus this afternoon as part of a systemwide celebration of American veterans, active military and their families.\n\n\"American veterans embody selflessness and sacrifice. They protect and defend our country so that we may live free. This tribute to our veterans is just a small token of our appreciation for those who answered the call to duty. I am so proud to have many veterans, active military and military families as part of our TGH team,\" said John Couris, president and CEO of Tampa General. \"We're especially grateful to Lt. Governor Jay Collins for joining us on this Veterans Day and for his patriotism.\"\n\nLt. Governor Collins was a first sergeant in the U.S. Army who served in the Special Forces unit.

Governor Collins requalified as a Green Beret and served for an additional five years. His military awards and decorations include the Legion of Merit, Soldier's Medal, Bronze Star Medal, Purple Heart, Meritorious Service Medal, Combat Infantryman Badge, Master Parachutist Badge, Military Freefall Parachutist Badge and numerous other personal, unit and service awards.

Governor Collins retired from the U.S. Army after 23 years in service to our nation. He served in the Florida Senate, representing Florida's 14th district, which contains parts of Hillsborough County. In August, he was appointed by Governor Ron DeSantis to serve in his current role.\n\n\"When I think about America, I often think of our veteran population. Veterans have been at the forefront of every challenge we have faced as a nation,\" said Lieutenant Governor Collins. \"I believe that when veterans come together, just as you did here, amazing things happen.\"\n\nThe Veterans Day celebration included an honor guard, a musical tribute and recognition of Tampa General team members who serve or have served in the U.S. military.\n\n\"Today's tribute was an incredible opportunity for Tampa General to celebrate our team members who have served, their contributions to our organization and their service to our nation,\" said Doug Leonardo, co-executive sponsor of the TGH Veterans Team Member Resource Group. \"Their loyalty, honor and courage is felt across the organization and serves as an inspiration to us all.\"\n\nThe event was organized by Tampa General's Veterans Team Member Resource Group, a volunteer-led initiative that promotes inclusion among veterans, active military, and supportive team members.

      "content": "Supreme Court extends its order blocking full SNAP payments, with shutdown potentially near an end\n\nThe Supreme Court has extended an order blocking full SNAP payments. The high court's decision Tuesday came amid signals that the government shutdown could soon end and food aid payments resume -- though exactly when is unknown. The order keeps in place at least for a few more days a chaotic situation. People who depend on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to feed their families in some states have received their full monthly allocations, while others have received nothing. SNAP helps 42 million Americans buy groceries. The order will expire just before midnight Thursday.\n\nThere's no timeline on when flight cuts will ease up after the government shutdown ends\n\nAirlines have canceled over 9,000 flights across the U.S. since the Federal Aviation Administration ordered flight cuts late last week. The cuts aim to ease demands on short-staffed control towers during the federal government shutdown. On Tuesday, another 1,200 flights were canceled as the FAA increased its target for reducing flights at major airports. Flights are expected to remain disrupted even as the shutdown nears an end, and cancellations are unlikely to ease right away. The pace of airline ticket sales for Thanksgiving travel has slowed as more travelers have reconsidered whether to fly amid all the delays and cancellations.\n\nThe Dow rallies 550 points to a record\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Most U.S. stocks rose and carried the market back to where it was before last week's swoon. The S&P 500 added 0.2% Tuesday after erasing a loss taken during the morning. It's been bouncing around lately, coming off Monday's vigorous rebound following its first losing week in four. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 1.2% to a record, surpassing its prior all-time high set two weeks ago. The Nasdaq composite lagged the market, though, as Nvidia got back to falling amid continued concerns that stocks caught up in the artificial-intelligence frenzy may have become too expensive. The Nasdaq dipped 0.3%.\n\nRecord-low temperatures shock the Southeast US while snowfall blankets parts of the Northeast\n\nThe southeastern U.S. has plunged into record-low temperatures, affecting 18 million people under a freeze warning across Alabama, Florida, and Georgia. The cold spell moved from the Northern Plains and brought an abrupt transition to wintry temperatures. Some daily records were shattered, including a low of 28 degrees in Jacksonville, Florida. In Florida, temperatures led to a \"falling iguana advisory\" as iguanas froze into survival mode and fell from trees. Meanwhile, parts of the Great Lakes and Northeast experienced significant snowfall, causing hazardous driving conditions. Forecasters expect temperatures to rise by the end of the week.\n\nByHeart recalls all baby formula sold nationwide as infant botulism outbreak grows\n\nBaby formula manufacturer ByHeart recalled all of its products sold nationwide Tuesday. The move comes days after some batches were recalled amid an expanding outbreak of infant botulism. According to state and federal health officials, at least 15 babies in 12 states have been sickened in the outbreak since August, with more cases pending. All the infants were hospitalized after consuming ByHeart formula. Parents and caregivers who have the formula in their homes should immediately stop using it and dispose of the product. Babies with symptoms of infant botulism need immediate medical care.\n\nTop diplomats from G7 countries meet in Canada as trade tensions rise with Trump\n\nNIAGARA-ON-THE-LAKE, Ontario (AP) -- Top diplomats from the Group of Seven industrialized democracies are converging on southern Ontario as tensions rise between the U.S. and traditional allies like Canada over defense spending and trade. Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand tells The Associated Press \"the relationship has to continue across a range of issues.\" Anand hosts U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and their counterparts from Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan on Tuesday and Wednesday. Anand also has invited the foreign ministers of Australia, Brazil, India, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, South Korea, South Africa and Ukraine. The meeting comes after the U.S. ended trade talks with Canada when the Ontario provincial government ran an anti-tariff advertisement.\n\nA suicide bomber targets an Islamabad court, killing 12 people and wounding 27, minister says\n\nISLAMABAD (AP) -- A suicide bomber has attacked outside a district court in Islamabad, killing 12 people and injuring 27. The explosion occurred on Tuesday near a police car. A breakaway faction of the Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility, but one of the group's commanders later disavowed the claim. The attack highlights the ongoing struggles of the Pakistani government against a resurgent Taliban and border tensions. Meanwhile, Pakistani security forces foiled an attack at an army-run college in a northwestern province. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned both attacks and called for swift justice. Tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan remain high, with recent peace talks stalling.\n\nIn Trump-dominated media world, editing video takes on new significance -- as BBC uproar shows\n\nThe job of videotape editors was once one of the least-noticed in the media world. Not anymore. The seemingly mundane task of editing interviews or speeches for broadcast was at the center of this week's resignation of two prominent BBC executives. Editing was also central to the lawsuit over the \"60 Minutes\" interview with Kamala Harris, settled this summer for $16 million, and a change in CBS News' policy on how \"Face the Nation\" airs interviews. Another common denominator in each of these cases was President Donald Trump. Increasingly, how news broadcasts choose to use video has become part of political battles.\n\nSally Kirkland, stage and screen star who earned an Oscar nomination in 'Anna,' dies at age 84\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Sally Kirkland, a former model turned actor, has died at age 84. Known for her roles in \"The Sting\" and the Oscar-nominated \"Anna,\" Kirkland died on Tuesday. Her friends set up a GoFundMe for her medical care after she suffered multiple fractures and infections. Kirkland's career spanned films like \"The Way We Were\" and \"JFK,\" and TV shows like \"Criminal Minds\" and \"Roseanne.\" She studied acting with renowned mentors and appeared in Shakespearean plays. Kirkland was also active in New Age groups and volunteered for various causes, including AIDS and cancer support.\n\nMavericks fire GM Nico Harrison 9 months after widely panned Luka Doncic trade\n\nDALLAS (AP) -- The Dallas Mavericks have fired general manager Nico Harrison nine months after the Luka Doncic trade that backfired on the franchise. The move comes a day after Mavericks governor Patrick Dumont attended a 116-114 loss to Milwaukee during which fans again chanted \"fire Nico.\" It's been a familiar scene since the blockbuster deal that brought Anthony Davis from the Los Angeles Lakers and angered the Dallas fan base. Harrison was in his fourth season and engineered three trades that helped Dallas on two deep playoff runs. The ill-fated Doncic deal and a slow start to the first full season without the young superstar led to a stunning downfall.",

Kirkland was also active in New Age groups and volunteered for various causes, including AIDS and cancer support.\n\nMavericks fire GM Nico Harrison 9 months after widely panned Luka Doncic trade\n\nDALLAS (AP) -- The Dallas Mavericks have fired general manager Nico Harrison nine months after the Luka Doncic trade that backfired on the franchise. The move comes a day after Mavericks governor Patrick Dumont attended a 116-114 loss to Milwaukee during which fans again chanted \"fire Nico.\" It's been a familiar scene since the blockbuster deal that brought Anthony Davis from the Los Angeles Lakers and angered the Dallas fan base. Harrison was in his fourth season and engineered three trades that helped Dallas on two deep playoff runs. The ill-fated Doncic deal and a slow start to the first full season without the young superstar led to a stunning downfall.",

According to recent reviews of AI apps, more people are now using artificial intelligence to plan trades, manage risk, and spot market trends early. Many of these platforms also offer real-time insights and education tools, helping beginners learn how professional traders analyse the market.\n\nAI trading apps use machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence, to analyse large amounts of financial data. The software finds patterns, predicts price changes, and can even trade automatically.\n\nFor new investors, this means they no longer need to spend hours reading charts. Instead, they can tell the app their goals, risk level, and budget. The app then tracks their investments in real time and gives advice based on market changes.\n\nBecause these tools are easy to use, more beginners feel confident investing. Modern apps regulated by the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) also give people more control and protection when using AI systems.\n\nAI trading apps in 2025 include tools that help people make smarter decisions:\n\nThese tools help people stay calm and avoid emotional trading. Instead of guessing, they act on facts and patterns that the AI identifies.\n\nRecent studies show that AI-based investing can lead to steadier results. Some UK brokers report that users who use AI tools had portfolios that were 12-18% more stable than those trading by hand.\n\nHowever, experts point out that AI's influence goes far beyond trading. Broader industry research, such as the analysis in AI transforms finance, highlights how automation and analytics are reshaping financial services, improving efficiency but also creating new challenges for regulators and investors alike.\n\nStill, AI is not perfect. Big world events, such as political changes or wars, can confuse algorithms. That is why investors should always check their settings and stay involved in their trades.\n\nAI trading apps are also becoming learning tools. Many now include \"practice\" modes that let users test trades with fake money. These simulations teach beginners about simple tools like:\n\nThis helps users learn without losing real money.\n\nThe FCA advises investors to choose apps that clearly explain how their AI systems work and let users make manual changes if needed.\n\nTrust is essential when using AI trading apps. The FCA now monitors algorithm-based platforms more closely to ensure they operate safely and fairly. Reputable apps are transparent about how they handle user data and manage risk.\n\nStill, not every system behaves as intended. A recent study, AI trading bots collude to fix prices, found that unsupervised bots can unintentionally work together to move markets, sparking new debates over regulation and accountability.\n\nEducation is helping close that gap. Organisations such as the UK Investor Education Alliance now teach how AI trading works and what risks to watch for. Online communities also share strategies and real results, giving beginners the confidence to trade responsibly.\n\nAI trading apps are doing more than just placing trades. They are changing how people think about money. Many new investors now test ideas, set long-term goals, and spread their money across several investments, much as professionals do.\n\nExperts say these habits make trading safer and steadier. For example, people now invest more in ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) and large company shares, which often move less than riskier assets.\n\nStill, AI should not replace human thinking. The best investors use both, letting AI handle the data while they make the final decisions.\n\nAI trading apps are helping people in 2025 invest with more confidence and control. They make markets easier to access, but they also remind us to stay informed and cautious.\n\nThe real advantage of AI comes when people learn how to use it wisely. Those who work with these tools, not blindly follow them, turn artificial intelligence into smart, human investing.",
