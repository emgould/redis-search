      "content": "It is understood that Sony and Microsoft are working on new console platforms--the PS6 and next Xbox--but when might they be released? According to Piers Harding-Rolls, the research director for games at Ampere Analysis, these new consoles could launch later than expected due to the GTA 6 delay. This could happen, but it's not what Ampere expects.\n\nHe told GI.biz that the delay of GTA 6 will have a \"significant impact on console sales dynamics in 2026.\" This is because, with GTA 6 now coming in November 2026 instead of May 2026, console sales will be \"even more back-loaded\" than normal. How does the GTA 6 delay impact the next-generation console release dates? Harding-Rolls said his company is modeling the new systems to launch in late 2027, but that could change if the platform-holders want to squeeze more juice out of GTA 6.\n\n\"Might the console companies be tempted to get more from the current console generation by riding the GTA 6 wave and waiting until 2028? The fact that games are now cross-gen makes this less of a factor, perhaps, but such is the size of the GTA franchise, the launch timing will get all areas of the games business thinking about their product strategies,\" he explained.\n\nHarding-Rolls went on to say that GTA 6 is going to be \"such an important driver of hardware sales,\" and not just when the game comes out, but for multiple years to follow. \"Sony and Microsoft will have wanted a much earlier release than late 2026 so they could generate momentum earlier in the cycle,\" he said.\n\nOne of the reasons that GTA 5 sold so well was because the game launched later in the PS3 and Xbox 360 lifecycles, coming multiple years after those consoles arrived. This meant that the install base of those machines was big at the time, and then Rockstar re-released GTA 5 for PS4 and Xbox One when those consoles came out in 2014. Then Rockstar put the game on PC in 2015 and then brought it to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S in 2022.\n\nBoth Sony and Microsoft have confirmed that they are working on new consoles, but neither has been officially announced. Sony, for its part, recently showed off some new experimental technology that could power its next console. Microsoft, meanwhile, announced a partnership with AMD earlier this year for future platforms. Rumors have swirled recently that Microsoft could quit the console business, but the company says that's not true.\n\nFor now, GTA 6 is confirmed only for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, but if Rockstar follows a similar playbook to GTA 5, fans can expect it to come to PC later and possibly new consoles.",

Deflation in the food basket deepened further to 3.7 per cent in October from 1.4 per cent last month,\" said Sinha.\n\nOverall, economists expect food inflation to stay at moderate levels on the back of healthy agricultural activity and a favourable base.\n\nFurthermore, adequate reservoir levels, and strong kharif sowing bode well for food price stability.\n\n\"Going forward, inflation is projected to average 0.9 per cent in Q3 before rising to 3.1 per cent in Q4 FY26. With food inflation subdued, we project average inflation for FY26 at 2.1 per cent,\" Sinha noted.\n\nAditi Nayar, Chief Economist, ICRA Ltd, said that the RBI MPC is likely to pare its CPI inflation projection for FY2026 further from 2.6 per cent (as mentioned in October 2025 meeting), driven by the soft sequential momentum in food prices as well as the impact of the GST rate rationalisation on several items in the CPI basket.\n\n\"This, along with the dovish tone of the October 2025 policy document, would support a 25-bps rate cut in the December 2025 policy review, unless Q2 FY26 GDP growth surprises on the upside,\" Nayar mentioned.",

He has demonstrated very firmly his commitment to guaranteeing a free and fair election,\" he said.\n\nThe governor also commended the INEC Chairman, Prof. Joash Ojo Amupitan, describing the election as the best conducted in the state since the introduction of technology into the process.\n\n\"This is your first outing, and I am very excited that your first impression is a very emphatic one. INEC delivered,\" Soludo added.\n\nThe governor, who secured a second term alongside his deputy, Onyeka Ibezim, said the outcome reflected the will of the people. He noted that the election recorded one of the highest levels of voter engagement in recent political history in the state.\n\n\"I just came out to say thank you to all of you and Ndi Anambra. This is a moment to say congratulations to Ndi Anambra. You have spoken,\" he said. \"Four years ago, you elected us with about 112,000 votes. This time, you spoke loudly. This victory is not just a victory; it is history made.\"\n\nHe highlighted that approximately 22 percent of registered voters participated in the election, describing it as unprecedented.\n\nHe also pointed out that his re-election marks only the third time an incumbent governor has been returned to office in Anambra since 1999, adding that he won with an emphatic 73 percent of the votes cast.\n\nPresident Tinubu: Soludo's Re-Election Affirmation of His Visionary Leadership\n\nI congratulate Professor Chukwuma Soludo on his re-election as the governor of Anambra State. The overwhelming victory he recorded in Saturday's poll has now made him the third governor in the state's political history to win a second term.\n\nI must also congratulate the people of Anambra State, the security agencies and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on the peaceful and successful conduct of the governorship election.\n\nProfessor Soludo's re-election is a testament to his visionary leadership and the significant progress the state has made under his guidance.\n\nGovernor Soludo, the Solution, has demonstrated that indeed knowledge is power and that academic principles can be applied in serving the people, undergirding accountability, transparency and prudent management of people and resources.\n\nI visited Anambra State in May this year, where I inaugurated some projects executed by the Soludo administration. I highlighted the good thinking behind the landmark projects being embarked upon by Mr Solution. That experience is indeed remarkable and will remain indelible in my mind.\n\nI commend Governor Soludo for bringing discipline, grace, brilliance, and a fresh perspective to governance in Anambra. Under him, Anambra is living up to its motto as the Light of the Nation.\n\nI urge Governor Soludo to be magnanimous in victory and to seek the cooperation of his opponents in the just-concluded elections.\n\nI assure Governor Soludo of my unwavering support, and I look forward to continued collaboration between Anambra and the Federal Government.\n\nThe victory of the opposition All Grand Progressives Alliance in the election again demonstrates the vitality of our political system and the fact that victory for any progressive and hardworking leader can hardly be encumbered or denied.\n\nI must also thank the new INEC Chairman, Professor Joash Amupitan, and his team for conducting what observers have described as a credible election, based on the reports I have received thus far.\n\nI charge the commission with maintaining the standards and further improving its performance, so we can continue to strengthen and deepen our electoral system.\n\nPresident & Commander-in-Chief of the Federal Republic of Nigeria",

This fruit helps local farmers increase their family incomes.\"\n\nThe day was cheered by music, dances, and colorful costumes themed around pomegranates. Visitors vied in contests ranging from hand-squeezing juice to endurance tests with heavy baskets of vibrant fruits.\n\n\"It's wonderful when people from different countries learn each other's traditions,\" said Fidan Gabilova, a tourist from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku. \"Our fruits and dishes are special -- both in appearance and taste. I think foreign guests should definitely try them.\"\n\nThe Goychay district, renowned for its high-quality produce, cultivates nearly 70 varieties of pomegranate, a fruit long deemed as the \"king of fruits\" in Azerbaijan. In 2020, this cultural significance earned global recognition when UNESCO inscribed Azerbaijan's pomegranate festival and related traditions on its Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.\n\n\"This festival is very important because it brings people together to enjoy and share our culture,\" said Arzu Chiraghi, a 19-year-old student from the Goychay State Management and Technology College. \"Pomegranates symbolize abundance, health, prosperity, unity and joy.\"\n\nThe harvest season in Goychay peaks from late October to early November. Around 4,000 hectares of orchards yield some 50,000 tons of pomegranates annually. According to Zeynalova, Goychay pomegranates are in high demand and mainly exported to Russia, Georgia and Central Asian countries.\n\n\"China is a vast market,\" she said. \"We would like Goychay pomegranates to reach Chinese consumers as well.\" ■",

The output index reached a net balance of 21% -- the highest since June 2024 -- driven by strong plans for research and development, capital investment, and new hiring. Manufacturers were especially bullish, posting a 25% net balance for output growth expectations, outpacing the service sector's 20%. Much of this optimism can be credited to targeted government stimulus, fresh product launches, and a deliberate push to expand production capacity and boost both domestic and international sales. Still, executives are keeping a close eye on labor shortages, rising costs -- particularly wages -- persistent US trade uncertainties, and the weak yen.\n\nJapanese stock markets tend to rally on improving business sentiment. As companies set bigger budgets and ramp up hiring, investors often see this as a signal for stronger earnings and fresh investment cycles. The Nikkei 225 and Topix indexes have previously gained on similar optimism, so this renewed confidence could drive further momentum. That said, challenges like rising costs and a soft yen may keep near-term gains in check.\n\nThe bigger picture: Japan is reasserting its global presence.\n\nJapan's upbeat outlook suggests it's gearing up to compete globally, especially in advanced manufacturing and technology. Higher spending on capital projects and innovation could help sharpen its edge in export markets, even as broader uncertainties -- like shifting US trade policies and higher global rates -- linger. If Japan maintains this confidence, its growth could help steady the global economy as slower countries look for support.",
